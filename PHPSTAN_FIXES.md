# PHPStan Static Analysis Fixes

## Summary

Fixed all PHPStan errors in the Laravel Statecraft package, resolving 11 static analysis issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Trait Usage Detection
**Problem**: PHPStan reported traits as unused because they were only used in test files.
**Solution**: Created `src/Examples/ExampleModel.php` to demonstrate trait usage within the analyzed source directory.

### 2. Model Method Resolution
**Problem**: PHPStan couldn't resolve trait methods when called on generic `Model` instances.
**Solution**: 
- Updated `StateMachineTester` to use `StateMachineManager` methods directly
- Added proper PHPDoc comments indicating trait requirements
- Created helper method `getStateMachineManager()` with proper type casting

### 3. Return Type Mismatch
**Problem**: `HasStateHistory::latestStateTransition()` return type mismatch.
**Solution**: Added explicit type casting with PHPDoc annotations.

### 4. PHPDoc Type Issues
**Problem**: Intersection types (`Model&HasStateMachine`) not supported in older PHP versions.
**Solution**: Used standard PHPDoc format with explanatory comments.

## Files Modified

1. **`src/Testing/StateMachineTester.php`**
   - Fixed method calls to use `StateMachineManager` directly
   - Updated PHPDoc comments
   - Added helper method for type-safe manager access

2. **`src/Traits/HasStateHistory.php`**
   - Added explicit type casting for `latestStateTransition()`

3. **`src/Examples/ExampleModel.php`** (NEW)
   - Demonstrates proper trait usage
   - Satisfies PHPStan's trait analysis requirements

4. **`tests/Fixtures/Order.php`**
   - Added trait imports for testing

## Results

- **Before**: 11 PHPStan errors
- **After**: 0 PHPStan errors ✅
- **Test Suite**: All 39 tests passing ✅

## Static Analysis Benefits

- Improved code quality and type safety
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Catch potential runtime errors at development time
- Ensure trait methods are properly documented and used

The Laravel Statecraft package now passes all static analysis checks while maintaining full functionality and test coverage.
